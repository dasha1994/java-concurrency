<h3>AsyncTask and FairSemaphore (Assignment 2b)</h3>

<HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Overview of the Assignment</H4>

In this assignment you'll extend your Palantiri solution for <A
HREF="http://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/cs892/tree/master/assignments/assignment2a/">assignment
2a</a> to use Java build-in monitor objects (for ugrads) or
<CODE>ReentrantLock</CODE>/<CODE>ConditionObject</CODE> (for grads) to
implement a <CODE>FairSemaphore</CODE> class using the <A
HREF="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/PDF/specific-notification.pdf">Specific
Notification</a> pattern.  This <CODE>FairSemaphore</CODE> class will
then be used by the Android AsyncTasks and the Java ThreadPoolExecutor
to develop an Android app containing a resource manager that restricts
the number of Beings from Middle-Earth who can concurrently gaze into
a fixed number of Palantiri. <P>

As before, this Android program is structured in accordance with the
<A
HREf="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter">Model-View-Presenter</A>
(MVP) pattern to help alleviate various accidental complexities
associated with developing concurrent Android apps.  The classes in
the View layer are provided to you.  The main PalantiriActivity first
prompts the user to enter various configuration parameters, such as
the number of Palantiri and Beings.  It then starts the
GazingSimulationActivity, which initializes the Presenter layer and
then starts the Presenter layer's processing logic.  The bulk of the
concurrent processing is performed by the Presenter and Model layers.
If you correctly complete the implementation of the skeletons in these
layers the Palantiri app will run successfully without throwing any
exceptions. <P>

<H4>Assignment Structure</H4>

The assignment is split into the following three directories:

<UL>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/main">app/src/main</A>, which conains the
skeletons you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>.  You'll need to open this project in
Android Studio. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/test">app/src/test</A>, which is a JUnit test
that exercises all the PalantiriManager and FairSemaphore features and
can be used to help test the functionality created in the
assignment. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/androidTest">app/src/androidTest</A>, which is
an Android Studio test that runs your app automatically.  You'll
automatically import this project into Android Studio. <P>

</UL>

To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. If you do not
have one created you can create it by clicking on the "AVD Manager"
button in the Android Studio IDE. <P>

<P><HR width=50% align=left><P>
<A NAME="description">
<H4>Program Description</H4>

In the <CODE>app/src/main/java/edu/vandy</CODE> directory you'll find
a number of files, all of which you should read.  You'll need to
modify several files containing the skeleton Java code that you'll
implement by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" comments to
provide a working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF
THE SKELETON - just fill in the "TODO -- You fill in here" portions!!!
<P>

In particular, you'll need to do the following: <P>

<UL>

<LI> Copy your solutions from assignment 2a into the
<CODE>PalantiriPresenter.java</CODE> and
<CODE>BeingAsyncTask.java</CODE> defined by the Presenter layer
residing in <CODE>app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/presenter</CODE>.  Make
sure you address my comments from your initial submission before you
copy the code into your assignment 2b solution. <P>

<LI> You'll also need to copy a working version of your
<CODE>PalantiriManager.java</CODE> in the Model layer at
<CODE>app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/model</CODE> from <A
HREF="http://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/cs892/tree/master/assignments/assignment2a/">assignment
2a</a> to mediate concurrent access to the Palantiri resources and
keep track of which Palantiri are currently free and which are in
use. Note that you'll need to replace the use of
<CODE>SimpleSemaphore</CODE> with <CODE>FairSemaphore</CODE>.<P>

<LI> Finally, you'll need to implement the <CODE>FairSemaphore</CODE>
  class by applying the "Specific Notification" pattern described <A
  HREF="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/PDF/specific-notification.pdf">here</a>.
  If you're an undergraduate your implementation must use Java
  built-in monitor objects, which are described <A
  HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JisaeZHO5As&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4KSJPUyaQCj7x--NQ6kvcX&index=18">here</a>
  and <A
  HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rv4YM2PmA8c&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4KSJPUyaQCj7x--NQ6kvcX&index=19">here</a>,
  respectively.  If you're a graduate student (or taking the class for
  graduate credit), you must use
  <CODE>ReentrantLock</CODE>/<CODE>ConditionObject</CODE>, which are
  described <A
  HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IW5YsMU1730&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4KSJPUyaQCj7x--NQ6kvcX&index=21">here</a>
  and <A
  HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_t9BOgQNkJ8&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4KSJPUyaQCj7x--NQ6kvcX&index=24">here</a>,
  respectively. Naturally, we'll cover these topics in class, as well.<P>
  Please use Java 8 features (such as lambda expressions and method
  references) where ever possible in your solution. <P>
</UL>

Your app will be considered "correct" if it successfully completes all
the JUnit tests.  Likewise, is must successfully complete all the
Expresso tests that simulate N Palantiri and M Beings without crashing
or throwing any exceptions. The Palantir and Beings are color coded to
represent their state: <P>

<UL>

<LI> <B>Beings</B> - Yellow means the Being is idle, Red means it's
waiting to acquire a Palantir, and Green means it's gazing into a
Palantir.<P> 

<LI> <B>Palantiri</B> - Gray means the Palantir is inactive, Green
means it is available for use, and Red means it is in use (i.e., a
Being is currently gazing into it).<P>

</UL>

A "correct" simulation should restrict the number of gazing Beings to
the number of Palantiri.  In other words, if there are four Palantiri
in the simulation, then only four Being dots should ever be Green on
the screen at a time. <P>

<H4>Skeleton Code</H4>

Skeleton code for this assignment is available from my <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/cs892/tree/master/assignments/assignment2b/">GitHub</a>
account.  Pull the appropriate skeleton code in your repository, read
it carefully, and complete the "TODO" markers. <P>

<H4>Concluding Remarks</H4>

This assignment builds upon the material we covered in previous
assignments (particularly the <CODE>SimpleSemaphore</CODE> class you
implemented in <A
HREF="http://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/cs892/tree/master/assignments/assignment1c/">assignment
1c</a>) to deepen your knowledge of writing concurrent programs whose
threads are coordinated via Java synchronizers. It doesn't require you
to program with Java Parallel Streams or CompletableFutures, which
we'll cover in upcoming assignments. <P>
