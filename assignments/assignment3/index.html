<h3>AsyncTask, ExecutorService, Barrier Synchronizers, and ConcurrentHashMap (Assignment 3)</h3>

<HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Overview of the Assignment</H4>

In this assignment you'll extend the Palantiri app from earlier
assignments to use AsyncTasks, ExecutorService, barrier synchronizers,
and ConcurrentHashMap to develop an Android app containing a resource
manager that restricts the number of Beings from Middle-Earth who can
concurrently gaze into a fixed number of Palantiri.  You should also
use Java 8 features (such as lambda expressions and method references,
and sequential streams) where ever possible in your solutions.

As before, this Android program is structured in accordance with the
<A
HREf="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter">Model-View-Presenter</A>
(MVP) pattern to help alleviate various accidental complexities
associated with developing concurrent Android apps. <P> The classes in
the View layer are provided to you.  The main PalantiriActivity first
prompts the user to enter various configuration parameters, such as
the number of Palantiri and Beings.  It then starts the
GazingSimulationActivity, which initializes the Presenter layer and
then starts the Presenter layer's processing logic.  The bulk of the
concurrent processing is performed by the Presenter and Model layers.
If you correctly complete the implementation of the skeletons in these
layers the Palantiri app will run successfully without throwing any
exceptions. <P>

This Android app uses various features of AsyncTask (which is
described <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQJnejqcAZw&index=32&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK">here</a>
and <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-o92SLinqk&index=33&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK">here</a>),
Executor Service with a cached thread pool (which is described <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NAlvSkK9-k&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4KSJPUyaQCj7x--NQ6kvcX&index=27">here</a>
and <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD8kTrnKH2Y&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4KSJPUyaQCj7x--NQ6kvcX&index=28&t=1267s">here</A>).
Likewise, you'll also need to understand how to use Java
CountDownLatch and CyclicBarrier barrier synchronizers (which are
described <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6LTKKTh_FA&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4KSJPUyaQCj7x--NQ6kvcX&index=25&t=30s">here</A>)
and Java ConcurrentHashMap (which is described <A
HREF="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap.html">here</A>).

Please watch these videos, read the documentation, and look at the
skeleton code to ensure you understand how to program AsyncTasks, the
ExecutorService, barrier synchronizers, and ConcurrentHashMaps.
Naturally, we'll also cover these topics in class. <P>

<H4>Assignment Structure</H4>

The assignment is split into the following three directories:

<UL>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/main">app/src/main</A>, which conains the
skeletons you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>.  You'll need to open this project in
Android Studio. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/test">app/src/test</A>, which is a JUnit test that
exercises all the PalantiriManager features and can be used to help
test the functionality created in the assignment. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/androidTest">app/src/androidTest</A>, which is
an Android Studio test that runs your app automatically.  You'll
automatically import this project into Android Studio. <P>

</UL>

To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. If you do not
have one created you can create it by clicking on the "AVD Manager"
button in the Android Studio IDE. <P>

<H4>Program Description</H4>

In the <CODE>app/src/main/java/edu/vandy</CODE> directory you'll find
a number of files, all of which you should read.  You'll need to
modify several files containing the skeleton Java code that you'll
implement by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" comments to
provide a working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF
THE SKELETON - just fill in the "TODO -- You fill in here" portions!!!
<P>

In particular, you'll need to do the following: <P>

<UL>

<LI> Finish the implementation of certain methods in the
<CODE>PalantiriPresenter.java</CODE> and
<CODE>BeingAsyncTask.java</CODE> defined by the Presenter layer
residing in <CODE>app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/presenter</CODE>.  You
can reuse some of your assignment 2b solution, with changes needed to
address the new requirements, e.g., support for the ExecutorService
and barrier synchronizers. <P>

<LI> You'll need to finish the implementation of the Model layer in
<CODE>app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/model/PalantiriManager.java</CODE>.
Undergraduates will use your Java FairSemaphore from <A
HREF="://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/cs282/tree/master/assignments/assignment2b/">assignment
2b</a> and ConcurrentHashMap to mediate concurrent access to the
Palantiri resources and keep track of which Palantiri are currently
free and which are in use. <P>

</UL>

Your app will be considered "correct" if it successfully completes a
simulation of N Palantiri and M Beings without crashing or throwing
any exceptions. The Palantir and Beings are color coded to represent
their state: <P>

<UL>

<LI> <B>Beings</B> - Yellow means the Being is idle, Red means it's
waiting to acquire a Palantir, and Green means it's gazing into a
Palantir.<P> 

<LI> <B>Palantiri</B> - Gray means the Palantir is inactive, Green
means it is available for use, and Red means it is in use (i.e., a
Being is currently gazing into it).<P>

</UL>

A "correct" simulation should restrict the number of gazing Beings to
the number of Palantiri.  In other words, if there are four Palantiri
in the simulation, then only four Being dots should ever be Green on
the screen at a time. <P>

<H4>Additional "TODO" Tasks for Graduate Students</H4>

Graduate students (or students who are taking this course for graduate
credit) must perform the following additional tasks:

<UL>

<LI> Use Java 8 features (such as lambda expressions, method
references, and streams) where ever possible in your solution.

</UL>

Undergraduates are welcome to implement these methods/features, but
it's not required.

<H4>Skeleton Code</H4>

Skeleton code for this assignment is available from my <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/cs892/tree/master/assignments/assignment3/">GitHub</a>
account.  Pull the appropriate skeleton code in your repository, read
it carefully, and complete the "TODO" markers.  The additional work
required by graduate students is clearly marked. <P>

<HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Concluding Remarks</H4>

This assignment builds upon the material we covered in assignment 1
and 2 to deepen your knowledge of writing concurrent programs using
Android's AsyncTask framework, the Java ExecutorService framework,
barrier synchronizers, and Java 8 features. It doesn't require you to
program with Java Parallel Streams or CompletableFutures, which we may
cover in future assignments. <P>
