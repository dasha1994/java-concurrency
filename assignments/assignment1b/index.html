<h3>Java Threads and Synchronizers (Assignment 1 - b)</h3>

<HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Overview of the Assignment</H4>

In this assignment, you will use the Java Thread, Runnable, Semaphore,
and AtomicLong classes, as well as Java synchronized statements, to
develop an Android app containing a resource manager that restricts
the number of Beings from Middle-Earth who can concurrently gaze into
a fixed number of Palantiri.  If you're still not a fan of Tolkein's
Lord of the Ring's trilogy, you can learn more about Palantiri <A
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir">here</a>. <P>

<P><HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Assignment Structure and Functionality</H4>

The assignment is split into the following three directories:

<UL> 

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/main">app/src/main</A>, which conains the
skeletons you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>.  You'll need to open this project in
Android Studio. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/test">app/src/test</A>, which is a JUnit test that
exercises all the PalantiriManager features and can be used to help
test the functionality created in the assignment. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/androidTest">app/src/androidTest</A>, which is
an Android Studio test that runs your app automatically.  You'll
automatically import this project into Android Studio. <P>

</UL>

To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. If you do not
have one created you can create it by clicking on the "AVD Manager"
button in the Android Studio IDE. <P>

<H4>Program Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

In the <CODE>app/src/main/java/edu/vandy</CODE> directory you'll find
a number of files, all of which you should read.  In particular, this
Android program is structured in accordance with the <A
HREf="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter">Model-View-Presenter</A>
(MVP) pattern.  The classes in the View layer are provided to you.
The main PalantiriActivity first prompts the user to enter various
configuration parameters, such as the number of Palantiri and Beings.
It then starts the GazingSimulationActivity, which initializes the
Presenter layer and then starts the Presenter layer's processing
logic.  The bulk of the concurrent processing is performed by the
Presenter and Model layers.  If you correctly complete the
implementation of skeletons in these layers the Palantiri app should
successfully run to completion without throwing any exceptions. <P>

In addition to reading the existing code, you'll need to modify
several files containing the skeleton Java code by completing the
"TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a working solution.  DO NOT
CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON - just fill in the
"TODO.." portions!!!  In particular, you'll need to do the following:
<P>

<UL>

<LI> Finish implementing the class methods defined by the Presenter
layer residing in
<CODE>app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/presenter/PalantiriPresenter.java</CODE>
and
<CODE>app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/presenter/BeingRunnable.java</CODE>
using your implementation from <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS892/tree/master/assignments/assignment1a/">part
a</a> of this assignment.

<LI> Finish implementing the Model layer in
<CODE>app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/model/PalantiriManager.java</CODE>.
You'll use a Java Semaphore, HashMap, and synchronized statements to
mediate concurrent access to the Palantiri resources and keep track of
which Palantiri are currently free and which are in use.  Java
Semaphores and synchronized statements are described <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoaZTkot6-g&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK&index=20">here</a>
and <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3rcTTF45cA&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK&index=25">here</a>,
respectively.<P>

</UL>

Your app will be considered "correct" if it successfully completes an
Espresso-based simulation of N Palantiri and M Beings without crashing
or throwing any exceptions. The Palantir and Beings are color coded to
represent their state: <P>

<UL>

<LI> <B>Beings</B> - Yellow means the Being is idle, Red means it's
waiting to acquire a Palantir, Green means it's gazing into a
Palantir, and Purple means the gazing was interrupted due to the lease
expiring.<P>

<LI> <B>Palantiri</B> - Gray means the Palantir is inactive, Green
means it is available for use, and Red means it is in use (i.e., a
Being is currently gazing into it).<P>

</UL>

A "correct" simulation should restrict the number of gazing Beings to
the number of Palantiri.  In other words, if there are four Palantiri
in the simulation, then only four Being dots should ever be Green on
the screen at a time. <P>

<H4>Additional "TODO" Tasks for Graduate Students</H4>

Graduate students (or students who are taking this course for graduate
credit) must perform the following additional tasks:

<UL>
<LI> Use Java 8 features whenever possible in your implementation.
These features include (but are not limited to) lambda expression,
method references, and the forEach() method, which are described <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPH4R4qAdrM&feature=youtu.be">here</A>.
We'll also cover these features in class.
</UL>

Undergraduates are welcome to implement these methods/features, but
it's not required.

<P><HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Skeleton Code</H4>

Skeleton code for this assignment is available from my <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS892/tree/master/assignments/assignment1b/">GitHub</a>
account.  Once you've setup your <A
HREF="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
"TODO" markers. The additional work required by graduate students is
clearly marked. <P>

<HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Concluding Remarks</H4>

This assignment is designed to help you get familiar with writing
multi-threaded programs using the Android Studio IDE, core Java
threading and synchronizer mechanisms, and some Java 8 features (for
graduate students or optionally for undergraduates).  It doesn't
require you to program any Android concurrency or communication
frameworks, which we'll cover in upcoming assignments.  I recommend
you watch the videos listed above and look at the code to ensure you
understand how to program Java threads and synchronizers.  Naturally,
we'll cover these topics in class, as well. <P>
