<h3>Executor Service and Futures (Assignment 4a)</h3>

<HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Overview of the Assignment</H4>

In the first part of this assignment you'll create a new Palantiri
solution that uses the Java ExecutorService and Java Futures to
develop an Android app containing a resource manager that restricts
the number of Beings from Middle-Earth who can concurrently gaze into
a fixed number of Palantiri.  As usual, this Android program is
structured in accordance with the <A
HREf="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter">Model-View-Presenter</A>
(MVP) pattern to help alleviate various accidental complexities
associated with developing concurrent Android apps. The classes in the
View layer are provided to you. <P>

The main PalantiriActivity first prompts the user to enter various
configuration parameters, such as the number of Palantiri and Beings.
It then starts the GazingSimulationActivity, which initializes the
Presenter layer and then starts the Presenter layer's processing
logic.  The bulk of the concurrent processing is performed by the
Presenter and Model layers.  If you correctly complete the
implementation of the skeletons in these layers the Palantiri app will
run successfully without throwing any exceptions. <P>

This Android app uses various features of the Java Executor framework,
which is described <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NAlvSkK9-k">here</a> and <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD8kTrnKH2Y">here</a>.  Please
watch these videos, read the documentation, and look at the skeleton
code to ensure you understand how to program the Java Executor
framework.  Naturally, we'll also cover these topics in class. <P>

<H4>Assignment Structure</H4>

The assignment is split into the following three directories:

<UL>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/main">app/src/main</A>, which conains the
skeletons you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>.  You'll need to open this project in
Android Studio. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/test">app/src/test</A>, which is a JUnit test that
exercises all the PalantiriManager features and can be used to help
test the functionality created in the assignment. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/androidTest">app/src/androidTest</A>, which is
an Android Studio test that runs your app automatically.  You'll
automatically import this project into Android Studio. <P>

</UL>

To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. If you do not
have one created you can create it by clicking on the "AVD Manager"
button in the Android Studio IDE. <P>

<P><HR width=50% align=left><P>
<A NAME="description">
<H4>Program Description</H4>

In the <CODE>app/src/main/java/edu/vandy</CODE> directory you'll find
a number of files, all of which you should read.  You'll need to
modify several files containing the skeleton Java code that you'll
implement by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" comments to
provide a working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF
THE SKELETON - just fill in the "TODO -- You fill in here" portions!!!
<P>

In particular, you'll need to do the following: <P>

<UL>

<LI> Finish the implementation of certain methods in the
<CODE>PalantiriPresenter.java</CODE> and
<CODE>BeingCallables.java</CODE> defined by the Presenter layer
residing in <CODE>app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/presenter</CODE>.
You'll need to (1) complete the <CODE>shutdown()</CODE>,
<CODE>beginBeingCallablesGazing()</CODE>,
<CODE>awaitCompletionOfFuture()</CODE> methods and (2) complete the
<CODE>gazeIntoPalantir()</CODE>, <CODE>call()</CODE>,
<CODE>incrementGazingCountAndCheck()</CODE>, and
<CODE>decrementGazingCount()</CODE> methods in
<CODE>BeingCallable.java</CODE> to handle updates and cancellations to
the GUI. <P>

<LI> Implement the <CODE>submitAll()</CODE> method in the
<CODE>app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/utils/StreamUtils.java</CODE> file,
which submits a collection of <CODE>Callable</CODE> objects to the
<CODE>ExecutorService</CODE> and return a list of futures to all the
submitted callables. <P>

<LI> You'll need to finish the implementation of the Model layer in
<CODE>app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/model</CODE> by copying a working
version of your <CODE>PalantiriManager.java</CODE> and
<CODE>FairSemaphore.java</CODE> implementation from <A
HREF="http://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/cs892/tree/master/assignments/assignment3/">assignment
3</a> to mediate concurrent access to the Palantiri resources and keep
track of which Palantiri are currently free and which are in use. <P>

</UL>

Your app will be considered "correct" if it successfully completes a
simulation of N Palantiri and M Beings without crashing or throwing
any exceptions. The Palantir and Beings are color coded to represent
their state: <P>

<UL>

<LI> <B>Beings</B> - Yellow means the Being is idle, Red means it's
waiting to acquire a Palantir, and Green means it's gazing into a
Palantir.<P> 

<LI> <B>Palantiri</B> - Gray means the Palantir is inactive, Green
means it is available for use, and Red means it is in use (i.e., a
Being is currently gazing into it).<P>

</UL>

A "correct" simulation should restrict the number of gazing Beings to
the number of Palantiri.  In other words, if there are four Palantiri
in the simulation, then only four Being dots should ever be Green on
the screen at a time. <P>

<H4>Additional "TODO" Tasks for Graduate Students</H4>

Graduate students (or students who are taking this course for graduate
credit) must perform the following additional tasks:

<UL>

<LI> Use Java 8 features (such as lambda expressions, method
references, and streams) where ever possible in your solution.

</UL>

Undergraduates are welcome to implement these methods/features, but
it's not required.

<P><HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Skeleton Code</H4>

Skeleton code for this assignment is available from my <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/cs892/tree/master/assignments/assignment4a/">GitHub</a>
account.  Pull the appropriate skeleton code in your repository, read
it carefully, and complete the "TODO" markers. <P>

<HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Concluding Remarks</H4>

This assignment builds upon the material we covered in previous
assignments to deepen your knowledge of writing concurrent programs
using Java's Executor framework and Java 8 features. It doesn't
require you to program with Java Parallel Streams or
CompletableFutures, which we may discuss later in the course. <P>
